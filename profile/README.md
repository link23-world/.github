Hi and welcome to the link23 sandbox, this is where we develop and host tools that are part of [link23](https://link23.world).

## About link23

link23 is a community-driven, global initiative concerned with promoting equity in genomics.
link23 is focused on the data and tools that can improve equity in genomic analysis by ensuring that people around the world can fairly benefit from cutting-edge genomic research.
For link23, a â€˜toolâ€™ is any solution that solves a problem that can, in some way, relate to genomic equity.
This could include software, a how-to guide for solving a particular task, a (printable) handbook for equity, a reference for deciding how to appropriately use equitable terminology, books that share stories of peopleâ€™s diagnostic odyssey, and more.

We are on a **mission** to improve equity and diversity in the providers, users, and beneficiaries of genomic tools through open science and inclusive research practices.
By doing this we hope to achieve our **vision** of a globally inclusive genomics landscape, where genomic tools equitably benefit all individuals, enabling breakthroughs in healthcare, research, and societal progress for all communities.

You can read (and comment on!) our [full strategy here](https://genomicsenglandltd.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Link23-world/EeV9ESxTaP1GiPQDNf1An98BfY7PEWsaNzQlFIB0u6E46Q?e=3KWVh8).

## Code of conduct

We want link23 to be a safe space that allows all people from all backgrounds to take part.
As you interact with the link23 community on GitHub, Slack, or any other platform, please make sure you abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/link23-world/sandbox/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our GitHub organisation from anyone.
To take part, and to learn about how we credit people, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/link23-world/sandbox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), which also explain how you can get support when working with GitHub.

## Tool lifecycle

Tools in the sandbox are categorised by the following lifecycle:

#### ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/link23_Tool-In_Development-purple?style=plastic&label=link23%20Tool&color=%23FFB300) In Development 

We believe in developing in the open, this means we use public repositories and open-source licenses from Day 0.
You are welcome to comment on, and contribute to, tools in development, but their design and interface will be rapidly changing so we do not recommend them for everyday use!

#### ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/link23_Tool-Prototype-purple?style=plastic&label=link23%20Tool&color=%2326913d) Prototype

We feel confident about sharing our prototype tools with the world.
They will not look their best and the user design is likely to change (maybe significantly) but the core concept of the tool should be fixed.
We welcome people testing out the tool, opening issues and pull requests, and commenting on the usefulness of the tool.
Developing in the open means that we are happy to fail openly too!
If a prototype just doesn't work and the tool isn't useful, we will publicly archive the repository and move onto our next best idea.
That's why this is a 'sandbox', it's a safe place to play with new ideas.

#### ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/link23_Tool-Stable-purple?style=plastic&label=link23%20Tool&color=%23005eb8) Stable

Stable tools are ready for everyday use.
Only minor changes (hopefully non-breaking!) should be made at this point and we are confident the tool fits a real-world need.
Stable tools will be highlighted in the [link23 toolbox](https://link23.world/toolbox).

#### ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/link23_Tool-Hosted-purple?style=plastic&label=link23%20Tool&color=%23df007d) Hosted

Hosted tools are those that were not created inside the link23 community but we have agreed to host in our organisation on behalf of another maintainer.
We want our space to be as easy to use as possible so we try not to place too many restrictions on new developers, therefore hosted tools may not fit into the lifecycle listed above.

## Hosting your tool

If you want your tool to be hosted in the link23 organisation, either [join our Slack](https://link23.world/slack) and message one of our leads (we're the ones with ðŸ‘‹ emojis next to our names), or open an issue in the [sandbox repository](https://github.com/link23-world/sandbox).

## Licensing and citing

All tools (in rare cases, exceptions may be mutually agreed) in this sandbox are licenced under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), full details [can be read here](https://github.com/link23-world/sandbox/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

All tools in the sandbox will have a citation file to help you cite tools correctly, in general these will look something like "link23. [TOOL NAME] (Version [VERSION NUMBER]) https://doi.org/[ZENODO DOI]".
